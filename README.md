# Exploring Agents

This is a replica of the single [**Exploring Agent**](https://github.com/Iulian-Stan/ExploringAgent).
The difference, as it is suggested in the title, is that there are 4 agents simultaneously "running"
on the map. All the concepts are preserved, each agent is fully independent and has its own goal 
(no collaboration nor coordination was implemented).

This is not the final version as there are glitches when multiple agents try to move the same artefact
due to weak synchronization mechanism.

## Interface

The screen is split into the entire map (left), and the explored one (right).
